Cyber: AES and DES Encryption in Jav
Overview

The Cyber repository provides Java implementations of two widely used symmetric encryption algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard). These implementations serve as educational resources for understanding the fundamentals of cryptographic algorithms and their practical applications.
Repository Structure

    aes.java: Contains the Java implementation of the AES encryption and decryption processes.

    README.md: Provides a brief overview of the project.

    Note: The repository currently focuses on AES. While DES is mentioned, its implementation is not present in the repository.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

    A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor
    GitHub+1GitHub+1

Compilation and Execution

    Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ARYAN-KUMAR-22/Cyber.git

    Navigate to the Project Directory:

    cd Cyber

    Compile the Java File:

    javac aes.java

    Run the Program:

    java aes

    Note: Ensure that the aes.java file contains a main method to execute the program.

Understanding AES

AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm standardized by NIST. It operates on fixed block sizes of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The algorithm involves multiple rounds of substitution, permutation, and mixing of the input plaintext to produce ciphertext.
Key Features

    Security: AES is widely adopted due to its strong security features.

    Efficiency: Designed for both hardware and software implementations.

    Flexibility: Supports multiple key lengths.

Potential Enhancements

To further develop this repository:

    Implement DES: Add the Java implementation of the DES algorithm to complement the AES implementation.

    User Input: Modify the program to accept user input for plaintext and keys.

    GUI Integration: Develop a graphical user interface for better user interaction.

    File Encryption: Extend functionality to encrypt and decrypt files.

    Error Handling: Incorporate comprehensive error handling and input validation.
